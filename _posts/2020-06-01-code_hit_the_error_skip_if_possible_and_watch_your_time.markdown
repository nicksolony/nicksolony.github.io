I loved working on Rails project, as I come acorss rails code quite often at work.

My biggest chalenge working with this project was time, and my own stubbornness. When I come across an issue, I can't move on, until I resolve it and it's almost impossible for me to give up. Well, lesson learned that's a bad habit.

While working on my project I got an error while trying to use `find_or_create_by` and I'll tell you about it in this post.
