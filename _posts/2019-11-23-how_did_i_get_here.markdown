I've never been good at writing, but the first blog post is due. So I will tell a story about ***"Why did you decide to learn software development?"***


I had my first coding lessons when I was around 10 years old back in Ukraine. I attended a computer programming club during the summer holidays. 
Keep in mind back then computers looked like this - ![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1bgXSAK3u7yEZu_g9S3Nr5GjkW0VCth8t)

And we had to use 5.25 Floppy disks to make it work.

I've learned some basic "BASIC" and was able to draw a circle and some other shapes at the end.

At the age of 13, I've discovered a Visual Basic which was way easier and more fun, it was a time of 3.5 floppy discs.

We've tried to build a video poker game since we were not allowed to play real one, but failed. Our resources were limited and we couldn't get any advice from anyone.

School back in Ukraine didn't really offer much programming and during college years I was more concentrated on other things. When I came to the United States, I changed different jobs and while working remotely I was able to watch some online courses and learned the basics of HTML. However, I was never able to actually learn to code and I ended up with the admin office job.

At my current job as an office manager, I learned PHP and SQL. When I say learn, I mean I looked at the code, googled parts of it and figured out what it meant.

I guess I always dreamt about being able to build websites, apps, and software on my own. After I spoke with some of my friends, and friends of friends I realized that coding Bootcamp might be a great opportunity for me to learn to code and switch not only my career but also my entire life and start doing something I've been interested in a long time.

This is just the start of my journey, but I'm looking forward to it and I'm sure I'll go all the way this time.
